## Hi :wave:

*I'm Fabien, 28 years old, currently learning the DevOps way at [Claranet](https://www.claranet.com/) as an intern in DevOps engineering.*

## About this website

When I got the time, I try to write some articles (in :fr:) in order to organize my knowledge. You can find the lastest articles just below.

This website is 100% open-source and the codebase is fully available on [this repo](https://github.com/fabienchevalier/fabienchevalier.github.io) in case of you wish to fork it for your own needs.
